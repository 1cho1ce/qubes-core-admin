## Note that policy parsing stops at the first match,
## so adding anything below "$anyvm $anyvm action" line will have no effect

## Please use a single # to start your custom comments

## Add your entries here, make sure to append ",target=dom0" to all allow/ask actions

## Include a single file for all admin.* methods to ease setting up Management VM.
## To allow only specific actions, edit specific policy file, like this one. To
## allow all of them, edit /etc/qubes-rpc/include/admin-all.
